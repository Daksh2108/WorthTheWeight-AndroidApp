       "Treadmill Workout to Increase Speed



0:00-5:00       - Start walking or jogging at an RPE 5, gradually increasing the incline (without increasing your speed), so that by the end of the first five minutes, you’re at an RPE 6

5:00-7:00       -Increase your speed while maintaining the incline, working at an RPE 7

7:00-9:00       - Increase the incline and maintain your speed, working at an RPE 8

9:00-12:00      - Reduce your speed, but maintain the incline, working at an RPE 7

12:00-15:00     - Increase your speed and, if you can, increase the incline. These are your last three minutes of hard work, so push it! Try to work up to an RPE 9

15:00-20:00     - Gradually reduce your speed and incline — by the last minute of your routine you should be back to an RPE 4 or 5

        Stationary Bike Workout for Beginners


1-Warm up at a comfortable pace and keep the resistance low for 5 mins.
2-Increase the resistance 1 to 4 increments or until you're working harder than your warm-up pace. You should feel you are working, but you should be able to carry on a conversation. This is your baseline pace. Do this for 3 minutes.
3-Increase your resistance and/or the pace once again until you're working slightly harder than baseline.Do this for 2 minutes.
4-Decrease the resistance or pace back to your baseline level. Do this for 3 minutes.
5-Increase your resistance and/or the pace once again until you're working slightly harder than your baseline level. Do this for 2 minutes.
6-Decrease the resistance or pace back to a comfortable level to cool down. Do this for 5 minutes.

Stationary Bike Workout for High Intensity Training


1- Warm up for 3-5 minutes: I usually have the resistance at a medium level so if its on a 1-20 scale I keep my warm-up and recovery time at around 10-12. When it comes time to do the intense interval, I bump it up to 15-18. Know that I am very fit and have been doing this for years, so if you are starting from ground zero don't go this intensely unless you want to throw up after your attempt.
2- 30 seconds high intensity, 1 minute low intensity (repeat 4 times)
3- 40 seconds high intensity, 1 minute low intensity (repeat 4 times)
4- 30 seconds high intensity, 1 minute low intensity (repeat 4 times)

   "   Mountain Pose (Tadasana)


        - In mountain pose there is a lot going on even though it may look like just standing. The heels root down, the muscles of the legs are engaged, the bones are stacked with the shoulders directly over the hips, the shoulder blades slide down the back, and the crown of the head rises. Don't forget to breathe.


    Raised Arms Pose (Urdhva Hastansana)


        - Inhale and bring your arms up and over your head. Raised arms pose is your basic morning stretch, but you are focusing on keeping the good alignment you established in mountain pose.
        - Stay grounded in the heels and keep your shoulders moving away from your ears at the same time that you reach up through your fingertips. Your gaze can come up to the hands, which can be shoulder's width apart or palms touching.


    Standing Forward Bend(Uttanasana)


        - Exhale and fold over your legs into a forward bend. If the hamstrings feel a little tight at first, bend the knees so that you can release your spine. Let the head hang heavy. Keep the legs gently bent with feet hip-width apart for better stability.(you can straighten the legs but it is not necessary).You can clasp opposite elbows with opposite hands while swaying gently side to side.


    Garland Pose (Malasana)


        - Move your feet out to the edges of your mat and bend your knees, coming into a squat. The toes may turn out if necessary. If your heels do not reach the floor, you can sit on two stacked blocks. This position is more accessible for many people.
        - This is a position that is quite natural for children but we lose the knack for it as adults. It's great for the hips and to counteract the effects of too much sitting in chairs and riding in cars. It's also a very useful pose if you like to garden.

        Lunge Pose


        - From malasana, come back into a forward fold with legs gently bent and feet underneath your hips. When you are ready, step your left leg to the back of your mat and bend your right knee for a deep lunge. Try to bring your bent knee directly over your ankle so your right thigh is parallel to the floor. Feel free to place hands on blocks to bring the floor to you.
        - Keep the left leg straight and strong with your heel reaching back. If this is too intense, you can drop your left knee to the mat instead. Stay five breaths before returning the left foot to the front of your mat next to the right one. Then repeat the lunge with the left foot forward and the right leg back.

        Plank Pose


        - After your second lunge, step the left foot to the back of the mat. Feet should be hip-width apart. Hips should be level with the shoulders. This is the classic preparation for a pushup. Stay here for five breaths while making sure that your hips do not drop too low or rise too high.
        - If your elbows tend to hyperextend, micro-bend them. Bring your knees down if necessary. After five breaths, release your knees to the mat and come back to sit on your heels, resting for a moment.

        Staff Pose


        - After catching your breath, swing your legs around so that they are outstretched in front of you. This is the seated equivalent of mountain pose, in that it seems very simple but has a lot going on.
        - The legs stay strong with the feet flexed. The shoulders stack over the hips so that the spine is long and straight. The arms may be straight or slightly bent.


    Seated Forward Bend (Paschimottanasana)


        - On an exhalation, bring your torso over your legs in a forward bend. Keep a gentle bend in the knees to keep this pose simple and manageable.
        - Work with your breath, lengthening the spine on each inhale and deepening your forward fold on each exhale. Stay for five breaths, keeping the feet flexed.


    Head to Knee Pose (Janu Sirsasana)


        - Come back up to sit and bend your left leg, bringing the sole of the left foot inside your right thigh. Use the same technique described above to deepen the pose using your breath. After five breaths, sit up and switch legs.

    Happy Baby Pose (Ananda Balasana)


        - Lie down on your back and hug your knees into your chest. Bend at the knees bringing the legs into a 90 degree angle. Flex your feet and hold onto them from the outside as your draw your knees downward toward your armpits.
        - Roll side to side a bit on your sacrum if it feels good. After five breaths, stretch your legs out on the floor and rest.

    "Abs:


1.Have your knees bent and the balls of your feet and heels placed flat on the ground.
2.Place your hands on opposing shoulders, so that your arms are crossed over your chest, or behind your head. This allows you a central rising point.
3.Tighten your abdominal muscles gently by drawing in your belly button to your spine.
4.Keeping your heels on the ground and your toes flat to the ground, slowly and gently lift your head first, followed by your shoulder blades. Focus your eyes on your bent knees, all the while gently contracting the abdominal muscles. Pull up from the floor until you are at a ninety-degree angle, or when the elbows are on, or past, the knees.
5.Hold the position for a second. Slowly bring the torso back to the floor but try to keep it slightly elevated off the ground. This means not to place your back flat to the ground but to keep a slight, yet relaxed, arch.

     "Standing Hamstring Stretch


Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent, arms by your sides.
Exhale as you bend forward at the hips, lowering your head toward the floor, while keeping your head, neck and shoulders relaxed.
Wrap your arms around the backs of your legs and hold anywhere from 45 seconds to two minutes.
Bend your knees and roll up when you're done.

Piriformis Stretch


The piriformis muscle is a deep internal hip rotator, located on the outside of the butt. Its primary role is external rotation, Atkins says. "Deep internal rotators, while small, produce a lot of the movement at the hip and are often overlooked." Since the piriformis crosses over the sciatic nerve, "if it is tight, it can result in sciatic nerve irritation, Cyrelson says. "Stretching this muscle can prevent potential future sciatica, or help treat it.
Sit on the floor with both legs extended in front of you.
Cross your right leg over your left, and place your right foot flat on the floor.
Place your right hand on the floor behind your body.
Place your left hand on your right quad or your left elbow on your right knee (as shown) and press your right leg to the left as you twist your torso to the right.
If the spinal rotation bothers your back, take it out and simply use your left hand to pull your right quad in and to the left.


Lunge With Spinal Twist


Atkins notes that this stretch is commonly referred to as the World's Greatest Stretch (WGS) in the fitness community. And for good reason: It's essential to help with posture-related pain or for people who sit for prolonged periods of time, says Dan Giordano, D.P.T., C.S.C.S., cofounder of Bespoke Treatments Physical Therapy in New York City and Seattle. "It helps open your hips and improve thoracic (mid-back) mobility," he tells SELF.
Start standing with your feet together.
Take a big step forward with your left foot, so that you are in a staggered stance.
Bend your left knee and drop into a lunge, keeping your right leg straight behind you with your toes on the ground, so you feel a stretch at the front of your right thigh.
Place your right hand on the floor and twist your upper body to the left as you extend your left arm toward the ceiling.
Hold for 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
Repeat on the other side.


Triceps Stretch


Kneel, sit, or stand tall with feet hip-width apart, arms extended overhead.
Bend your right elbow and reach your right hand to touch the top middle of your back.
Reach your left hand overhead and grasp just below your right elbow.
Gently pull your right elbow down and toward your head.
Switch arms and repeat.

Figure Four Stretch


Lie on your back with your feet flat on the floor.
Cross your left foot over your right quad.
Lift your right leg off the floor. Grab onto the back of your right leg and gently pull it toward your chest.
When you feel a comfortable stretch, hold there.
Hold for 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
Switch sides and repeat.


90/90 Stretch


Sit with your right knee bent at 90-degrees in front of you, calf perpendicular to your body and the sole of your foot facing to the left. Keep your right foot flexed.
Let your leg rest flat on the floor.
Place your left knee to the left of your body, and bend the knee so that your foot faces behind you. Keep your left foot flexed.
Keep your right butt cheek on the floor. Try to move the left cheek as close to the floor as possible. It may not be possible if you're super tight.
Hold for 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
Repeat on the other side.

Frog Stretch


Start on all fours.
Slide your knees wider than shoulder-width apart.
Turn your toes out and rest the inner edges of your feet flat on the floor.
Shift your hips back toward your heels.
Move from your hands to your forearms to get a deeper stretch, if possible.
Hold  for 30 seconds to 2 minutes.


Butterfly Stretch


Sit tall on the floor with the soles of your feet together, knees bent out to sides.
Hold onto your ankles or feet, engage your abs, and slowly lower your body toward your feet as far as you can while pressing your knees toward the floor.
If you're too tight to bend over, simply press your knees down.
Hold this stretch for 30 seconds to 2 minutes.


Seated Shoulder Squeeze


Sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.
Clasp your hands behind your lower back.
Straighten and extend your arms and squeeze your shoulder blades together.
Do this for 3 seconds, and then release. Repeat 5 to 10 times.


Side Bend Stretch


Kneel on the floor with your legs together, back straight, and core tight.
Extend your left leg out to the side. Keep it perpendicular to your body (not in front or behind you).
Extend your right arm overhead, rest your left arm on your left leg, and gently bend your torso and right arm to the left side.
Keep your hips facing forward.
Hold this stretch for 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
Repeat on the other side.
